## About me

### Introduction

Hi, I'm Nicanor, a software developer that loves to arg about technology and development, I'm convinced that the technological stack you know is not relevant
to cover a new work with different technologies because since you have clear knowledge about software architecture, you will be able to adapt to this new stack
really fast, so I'm learning about it because I'm sure that is the better way to be a better developer.


### My path
- I'm currently trying to learn about architecture (the more I learn the more I figure out that there is a not ending path).
- I'm trying to learn new languajes and frameworks and improve my knowledge on the ones I know.
- My objective in the short term is to learn about cloud and frontend so I can be a fullstack developer.

### My experience

- I started as COBOL developer but moved to VFPü¶ä soon, working in an insurance related project my first years.

  ***Tech Stack:***
    * VFP 9
    * Oracle
    * Plastic SCM

- My next experience weas in IBM IIB 9 (actually called ACE), I was part of an architecture team where we built cross components to normalize common
operations, we was too responsibles of code's good quality.

  ***Tech Stack:***
    * IBM Integration Bus 9
    * IBM MQ
    * Java 1.8
    * SQL Server
    * SVN
    * Git
    * Jira
    * Confluence
    * Ant
  
- After that I learnt Spring boot üçÉ and I gone to a project on this technology, in this experience I was involved in some different projects, but mostly with the same stack until I end in a LTS project on Vert.x:

  ***Tech Stack:***
    * Spring boot (JPA, Hibernate, Web for rest services)
    * Java 11, 17
    * Vert.x
    * Kafka with Avro schemas
    * PostgreSQL
 
- Then I went to the team where I think I've grown more, with Sngular I stayed in some proyects based too on Spring boot, but evolving my architechture knowledge significantly:

  ***Tech Stack:***
    * Spring boot (JPA, Hibernate, Web for rest services)
    * Java 17, 21
    * PostgreSQL
    * Hexagonal architechture
    * Desing patterns

- As last, my actual adventure is a project where I came with the promise on doing more architechture stuff, but I'm simply building technical documents based on the information from the core and the needs of the REST APIs.

  ***Tech Stack:***
    * ApenAPI
    * Swagger
    * API Connect
    * APIGee
